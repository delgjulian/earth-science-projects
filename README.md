# Earth Science Simulation Projects 🌍

This repository contains a curated collection of **computational and simulation-based projects in Earth Sciences**, focused on geophysics, hydrogeology, geothermal systems, volcanology, and applied environmental modeling.

The projects combine **physics-based reasoning**, **numerical simulation**, and **data-driven analysis**, and are intended as exploratory tools, teaching prototypes, and research-oriented computational experiments.

---

## 📄 Repository Overview

This repository serves as a **portfolio of applied Earth Science simulations**, developed using Python and designed to explore physical processes such as:

- Groundwater flow and subsurface transport
- Geothermal system behavior
- Rock deformation and stress propagation
- Seismic signal exploration and visualization
- Volcanic monitoring dashboards
- Environmental and climatological analysis

The code emphasizes **conceptual clarity** and **physical intuition** rather than black-box modeling.
