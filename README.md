# Earth Science Simulation Projects 🌍

This repository contains a collection of **exploratory computational experiments and prototype simulations** in Earth and environmental sciences.

The projects included here are **not presented as standalone research outputs**, but rather as **technical demonstrations, learning-oriented simulations, and sandbox-style computational experiments** developed to explore physical processes, numerical methods, and visualization techniques in geosciences.

## 📄 Repository Overview

This repository serves as a **technical sandbox** for applied Earth Science simulations, implemented primarily in Python.  
The scripts focus on developing **physical intuition**, **numerical reasoning**, and **conceptual understanding** of Earth system processes rather than producing finalized, publication-ready research results.

The simulations explore phenomena such as:

- Groundwater flow and subsurface transport
- Geothermal system behavior
- Rock deformation and stress propagation
- Seismic signal exploration and visualization
- Volcanic monitoring concepts
- Environmental and climatological variables

Each script is designed to be **self-contained**, modifiable, and suitable for experimentation.

## 🚀 Intended Use

This repository is **not a unified software package** nor a collection of finalized research projects.

Users are encouraged to:
- Run individual scripts independently
- Modify parameters to explore physical behavior
- Use the code as a starting point for further development, learning, or teaching
